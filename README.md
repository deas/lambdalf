# Lambdalf -- Clojure support for Alfresco

**WARNING**: This may not be the fork you are looking for.

This library adds [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org/) support to the open source
[Alfresco Content Management System](http://www.alfresco.com/). Specifically, it:

 * adds an idiomatic Clojure wrapper around (an increasing %age of) the [Alfresco Java API](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Java_Foundation_API)
 * provides support for implementing Alfresco extension points in Clojure, including
   [behaviours](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/behave.clj), and
   [web scripts](https://github.com/lambdalf/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/spring/surf/webscript.clj)
 * adds an nREPL server to the Alfresco server (disabled by default - requires administrator rights to enable),
   allowing for productive REPL-style experimentation and development within Alfresco
 * packages all of this, along with the Clojure runtime, into a **JAR** that 3rd party code can depend on (thereby avoiding
  conflicts between different Clojure extensions). This fork does **not** use AMP in any way.

## Packaging
It is this **JAR** artifact that should be deployed to a running
Alfresco server, prior to the deployment of your own JAR or AMP if you want to use the latter.

## Installing lambdalf into Alfresco
Run `lein uberjar` and drop that file in `alfresco/WEB-INF/lib`.

### Opening a REPL
For security reasons (i.e. **it opens a massive script injection attack hole!**) the nREPL server included in lambdalf is
not running by default. To enable it (**keeping in mind that it opens a massive script injection attack hole!**) an
administrator-only HTTP POST Web Script is provided at `/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl`. For a default installation
of Alfresco on localhost, you can run:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin -X POST http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

to enable the nREPL server.  The Web Script's JSON response includes the port that the nREPL server is running on
(default is 7888).  From there you can use leiningen's built-in nREPL client to connect to the nREPL server:

```shell
    $ lein repl :connect 7888
```

See below for some example Clojure expressions that can validate the installation (although being able to connect is
itself a good sign that everything's hunky dory).

To disable the nREPL server, you may issue an HTTP DELETE to the same Web Script:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

You may also query the status of the nREPL server via an HTTP GET:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

## Developing with lambdalf

lambdalf is (NOT YET!) available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :plugins, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf "#.#.#"]
```

Here's some sample code from an nREPL session connected to a running Alfresco repository. Note that there are
[better ways](https://github.com/lambdalf/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/nodes.clj#L65) to get a handle to the Company
Home `nodeRef`.  Note also that unlike Alfresco's native Java API, each `ResultSet` is automatically closed after a search.

    user> (def company-home
              (a/as-admin
               (first
                (s/query "PATH:\"/*\" AND TYPE:\"cm:folder\""))))
    #'user/company-home

        (n/properties company-home)))
